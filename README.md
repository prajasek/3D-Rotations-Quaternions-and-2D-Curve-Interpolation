# CADD-Applications- Graphics

Hermite Interpolation, 4-point Interpolation to describe curves in 2D space.
(Can be extended to surfaces).

Implementation of 3-D Rotations using Rotation matrices and Quaternions. 
Quaternion Rotations are used in smoothing rotations and animations. One of the applications is in 3-D Game animations.
