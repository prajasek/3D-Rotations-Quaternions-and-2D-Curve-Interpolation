# CADD-Applications- Graphics

Hermite Interpolation, 4-point Interpolation to describe curves in 2D space.
(Can be extended to surfaces).

Implementation of 3-D Rotations using Rotation matrices and Quaternions. 
Quaternion Rotations are used in smoothing rotations and animations. One of the applications is in 3-D Game animations.

Three PNG Files: 
When P1=P4 --> When initial point in the curve overlaps with the end point in 4-point interpolation.
When P2=P4 --> When second point and third point are the same.
When Hermite Curve has a slope=0 when the initial tangent vectors are equal and mirrored .
